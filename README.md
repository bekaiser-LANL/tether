# Tether: A suite of LLM benchmarks for ASC-related tasks 

To benchmark a model you need to choose the model (e.g., llama3.2), the interface (e.g., Ollama), the benchmarks you would like to run (e.g., 'standardDeviation') in run.py. Then you must choose generate = True or False and save = True or False for each benchmark. If generate = True then a new randomly-generated instantiation of the benchmark will be run. If generate = False, then a previously saved version of the benchmark will run using the corresponding text file in /benchmarks/saved/. If save = True the benchmark will be saved to /benchmarks/saved/.

# How to use Tether

## Generate a benchmark

`$ python3 generate.py BENCHMARK /PATH/benchmarks/`

## Run a benchmark

`$ python3 run.py BENCHMARK MODEL /PATH/benchmarks/`

## Analyze a benchmark

# Models

## Adding your own model

## OpenAI models

'o1' 'gpt-4o' 'o3-mini' 'gpt-4.5-preview'

## Ollama models

'llama3.2' 'llama3'

# Benchmarks 

## SignificantFigures
Randomly generates floating point numbers and a random number of significant figures, then asks the LLM to express the number in scientific E notation using the correct number of significant figures. 

## 'StandardDeviation'
Randomly generates sets of 20 integers, then asks the LLM to compute the standard deviation to 4 decimal places by default.

## MediatedCausality 
### MediatedCausalityArithmetic
### MediatedCausality_bootstrap
### MediatedCausalitySmoking_bootstrap
Randomly generates tables of 3 binary variables corresponding to cause (X, smoking), effect (Y, lung cancer), and mediator (Z, tar in lungs) with randomly chosen sample sizes. Asks the LLM to determine if A) X causes Y with 95% confidence, B) X does not cause Y with 95% confidence, or C) the causal relationship is uncertain at the 95% confidence level. The correct answer is computed using the front door criterion and the standard error of proportion is used to compute the 95% confidence intervals.

# Using Tether to benchmark LLaMa models with Ollama

1) Download ollama: https://ollama.com/download  
2) Open the downloaded zip, install   
3) Enter the following terminal command for each model you plan on using, for example:  

`$ ollama pull llama3`   

4) Now enter 

`$ ollama serve` 

and let it hang. This runs a server process that listens for API requests.

5) Now open another terminal, change the model choice in Tether/run.py to the llama model you pulled, and run.
